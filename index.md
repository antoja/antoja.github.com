Antoj'a Designer jewelry is for all types of people. Antoj'a was born from the need to create clothing that squanders originality and creativity in each use. It is a fusion of traditional ideas with innovative ideas, forms and significant interpretations. The jewelry is unique, made entirely by hand taking inspiration from street art. There are no limits, just as the imagination. Each piece is made with the intention that those who wear it be the center of attention. For this reason, it is important that my clients use their own vision. It's art.
