description: "I was born to love art. A love for jewelry and dancing has been with me ever since I can remember. I was born in the town of Arecibo in Puerto Rico.  This town stands for coastal lifestyle, the beach being the starting point for my inspiration. Before I completely dedicated myself to jewelry design, my favorite activity was dance. Modern dance, ballet, jazz, salsa, and hip hop were the styles in which i participated.  I trained with teachers on the island and at an international level too which helped me with my first work experience for more than 5 years.

It is not until I go to college that my big project as a designer began. I started designing pieces for myself, totally different - from recycled materials. People became interested in my designs and that's when I decide to launch a line called Krystal. The centerpiece of this line was a one sided earring. I completed my studies as a Professional in \"Family and Consumer Science\" after which I decided to devote myself completely to design. This is when Antoj'a and the Corre Lola collection were born.This collection captures the rise of cycling worldwide.

The next step in my journey was studying Fashion Design and Product Design at the esteemed Parsons-The New School for Design, New York. Although only for one summer, both those courses broadened by horizons grossly."
